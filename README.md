A Free Code Camp JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Project
The function takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. It splits the input string into an array of characters and iterates over each character. For each character, it checks if it is a capital letter (ASCII codes 65-90). If it is a capital letter, it shifts the character code by 13 using the ROT13 cipher. Otherwise, it leaves the character unchanged. Finally, it joins the array of characters back into a string and returns the decoded string.
